What is docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It Packages an application and it's all dependency together in a form of a container. 

-Docker architecture: Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.

Some Important Basics of docker to know:

-Docker file : A Docker file is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
-Docker Image : A Docker image is a Template to create docker container.
-Docker Container: A Docker container is running instance of docker image. container holds entire package to run application.
